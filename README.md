### Shopping - What Requirements do we look for when buying a machine?

- cpu
- display
- gpu
- ram - performance
- storage - called volume in cloud - peristant/non-volatile
- motherboard
- power
- security, firewalls etc

When making/buying a machine you have to decide upon the specification, the costs and benefits, the purposes, etc. 

When going onto the cloud, you negate all of the specific machine issues

### Conventions & Practices

- AWS naming convention for services - `group_person_task` - for example - `eng122_Shahrukh_ec2`

- When not in use (09:00 - 18:00) terminate. It costs money to run. Ask if you want to run out of hours, so that it can be authorised.

- for the duration of this course ensure you are logged in in Ireland - `Europe (Ireland) eu-west-1`.

- Do not delete anyone else's services

- DO NOT share AWS account details or keys with anyone - so don't push them to github!!!
